For when you want to look impressive without doing anything.

These files print code to your screen, filling up your tiled terminals with impressive-looking gobbledygook. No developer should be without a few little scripts like these!

lookImpressive opens Java files

pyImpress runs a line of code counter that returns a bunch of metrics no one else will ever care about

pyImpress2 prints html to the screen - very handy for front end devs and people who do a lot of HTML-based documentation like me.
