# Java Dev Tools

These are some quick and dirty development tools I hacked together over time, which I keep finding uses for.

-----

## Code Journal

Maintains a simple timestamped journal of activities with useful codes attached. Great for tracking what I've done over time for, say, performance reviews. Use *Start Day* at the start of your day, and it will create a new pretty headline that's easy to read and navigate with.

## Journal

Just a timestamped set of entries. Not as useful as Code Journal, but nice to have around

## Remove Eclipse Artifacts

People tend to ignore their .gitignore files. This removes eclipse artifacts from the project - very useful in a lot of cases.

## Remove Orig Artifacts

.orig files bug me. Merges happen, and it's all too easy to accidentally screw it up and have duplicate files lying around. Dump them!

## Model Builder

I hate creating POJOS. Tab-separated tables are more my speed, and they're easy to read and write.

## CSV To Table

Tab-separated tables to the rescue yet again. HTML tables are a bear to create.

## Entity from DB

Make a Hibernate-friendly DTO out of your MySql workbench schema.
